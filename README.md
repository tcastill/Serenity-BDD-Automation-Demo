# Serenity and Cucumber POC using the Screenplay Pattern

This repository is to give a working automation sample using a framework called Serenity BDD with the Screenplay Pattern. It runs tests against the page https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ where it gives examples of different types of website interactions for a user.

# What is Serenity BDD?
Serenity BDD is a library that makes it easier to write high quality automated acceptance tests, with powerful reporting and living documentation features. It has strong support for both web testing with Selenium, and API testing using RestAssured.

Serenity strongly encourages good test automation design, and supports several design patterns, including classic Page Objects, the newer Lean Page Objects/ Action Classes approach, and the more sophisticated and flexible Screenplay pattern.

The latest version of Serenity supports Cucumber 6.x.

# What is the Screenplay Pattern?

The Screenplay Pattern is a modern test automation design pattern intented to make it easier to write scalabble, maintainable test code. You can get a quick overview of a simple Screenplay test [click here](https://serenity-bdd.github.io/docs/screenplay/screenplay_fundamentals).

# Executing the tests
To run the sample project, you can either just run the `CucumberTestSuite` test runner class, or run either `mvn verify` or `gradle test` from the command line.

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Ddriver=firefox
```
Or
```json
$ gradle clean test -Pdriver=firefox
```

The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory.

# How to run remotely in a selenium grid

You can configure your tests to run against this server by setting three properties:

- Set the webdriver.driver property to remote.
- Set the webdriver.remote.url property to the address of your Selenium Grid instance (http://localhost:4444 by default). 
- Set the webdriver.remote.driver property to the name of the driver you want to run (e.g. "chrome").

```Remote
webdriver {
    driver = remote
    remote {
        url="http://localhost:4444"
        driver=chrome
    }
}
```

FYI: Serenity 2.2.13 introduced integration with WebdriverManager to download webdriver binaries.

# Generating the reports
Since the Serenity reports contain aggregate information about all of the tests, they are not generated after each individual test (as this would be extremenly inefficient). Rather, The Full Serenity reports are generated by the `serenity-maven-plugin`. You can trigger this by running `mvn serenity:aggregate` from the command line or from your IDE.

They reports are also integrated into the Maven build process: the following code in the `pom.xml` file causes the reports to be generated automatically once all the tests have completed when you run `mvn verify`?

            </plugin>
